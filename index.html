                <h1>New search tools added on our latest dictionary!</h1>
                <p class="date">12 December 2019</p>
                <p>We've been working on updating our obsolete dictionary search system for quite a while now and we're glad to announce that it recieved its official update!</p> 
                <p>From now on you can search not only by lemma but also in the dictionary article itself. Another new useful feature is the search in all our main languages - English, Latin, Ancient Greek, Sanskrit and Bulgarian using the language's writing system without transliteration.</p>
