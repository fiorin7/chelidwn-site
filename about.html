            <p>It all started in 2012 when five college students (pictured on the left) tired of carrying huge dictionaries around came together to try and make a digital version of the university Klingon dictionary. Once it was finished it served well not only us but also other students and professors alike.</p>
            <p>Soon we all became rich in various ways - three of us had become stuffed animals seller and the other two were doing youtube as a job. We used the money to found our small association for digitization of classical materials.</p>
            <p>Since then we managed to finish numerous projects in different humanitarian fields and our team grew threefold, including Matusek, my only consolation at eleven pm making this site.</p>
